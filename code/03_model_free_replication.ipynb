    "Although volatility derivatives, variance swaps and futures are considered second generation derivatives (since they are defined on volatility and variance directly), some of the most elegant and robust results of quantitative finance apply to these kinds of derivatives. In particular, it is possible to statically replicate realized variance without using any kind of specific model. This, for example, does not apply to most other important concepts in option pricing and trading, like implied volatility or delta hedging of options."

By contrast, the VSTOXX and VIX volatility index calculation only takes as input market-observed options prices. This is possible since realized variance at a given future date can be replicated by strips of European call and put prices maturing at the same date. The realized volatility can then be extracted by taking the square root of the realized variance. The calculation of the VSTOXX and VIX avoids a \"model-bias\" and uses standard market practice for the valuation of important variance related instruments, like variance swaps."

    "This chapter introduces the elegant theory of the model-free replication of realized variance and variance swaps which dates back at least to Breeden and Litzenberger (1978). The role of log contracts and constant dollar gamma positions is discussed. Numerical examples also illustrate how to construct constant dollar gamma options positions in practice. Finally, based on this theory the definition of the VSTOXX and VIX volatility indexes is presented and justified. Subsequent chapters draw in different ways on these cornerstones in the theory of volatility and variance modeling, measuring and trading. "
